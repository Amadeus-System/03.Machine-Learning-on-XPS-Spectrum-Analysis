## Abstract

A data-driven study of material properties and functional materials design based on it requires
high-throughput and comparative analyses of the results of experimental spectroscopy with those
from first-principles electronic structure calculations. Hence, an efficient machine-learning-based
computational tool to extract electronic structure information from experimental data without
human intervention is in high demand. Here, we test the capability of deep neural network
models to fit photoemission spectroscopy (PES) data in the frequency domain with unknown PES
peak positions, numbers, and widths. A one-dimensional convolution neural network (CNN) was
employed in combination with fully connected layers (FCL), and the trained model was applied
to photoemission spectra for the sulfur 2p states in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) molecules and
oxygen 1s states in indium tin oxide (ITO). We conclude by further discussing potential ways to
improve the performance of the model.
